        Sean -  Nobody is as kind and                   Janpol - Jose, you have been one of my best friends since high school. From 9th grade when 
        compassionate as you! May this day              you hated me for being a loud ass funny kid to now this stud of a man. I remember we 
        bring forth all the good that you               started talking a lot was because we would take the breakfast each morning and we would talk 
        give. Wishing you the best birthday!            and I got to know what type of person you were. High school was easy, fun, exciting but most 
                                                        importantly it was filled with memories of us doing the dumbest thingsüòÇ. You were one of 
                                                        those people who was just care free and were one of the popular kids always saying hi to 
                                                        every single kidüòÇ. You helped me through some of the hardest points in my life and I will 
                                                        always be grateful. Playing video games with you and the group was always funny because 
                                                        I would remember how mad you would get when I would dog on your ass so hard you stopped 
                                                        talkingüòÇso I would have to let you beat me. Or those times when I was lagging and you 
                                                        would dog on me and be laughing and singing. Just remember I will always be better at APEXüòò.
        Jose and Mo you guys truly became one of my brothers 
        because of the stuff we been through and I can‚Äôt thank
        you guys enough for the friendship and memories.
